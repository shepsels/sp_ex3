/**
 * List Container Summary
 *
 * Implements a list container type.
 * The elements of the list are of type SPListElement, please refer
 * to SPListElement.h for usage.
 * The list has an internal iterator for external use. For all functions
 * where the state of the iterator after calling that function is not stated,
 * the state of the iterator is undefined. That is you cannot assume anything about it.
 *
 * The following functions are available:
 *
 *   spListCreate               - Creates a new empty list
 *   spListDestroy              - Deletes an existing list and frees all resources
 *   spListCopy                 - Copies an existing list
 *   spListSize                 - Returns the size of a given list
 *   spListFirst                - Sets the internal iterator to the first element
 *                                in the list, and returns it.
 *   spListNext                 - Advances the internal iterator to the next
 *                                element and returns it.
 *   spListInsertFirst          - Inserts an element in the beginning of the list
 *   spListInsertLast           - Inserts an element in the end of the list
 *   spListInsertBeforeCurrent  - Inserts an element right before the place of
 *                                internal iterator
 *   spListInsertAfterCurrent   - Inserts an element right after the place of the
 *                                internal iterator
 *   spListRemoveCurrent        - Removes the element pointed by the internal
 *                                iterator
 *   spListGetCurrent           - Return the current element (pointed by the
 *                                internal iterator)
 *   spListGetFirst             - Sets the internal iterator (also called current
 *                                element) to be the first element in the list and
 *                                return it.
 *   spListGetNext              - Advances the list's iterator to the next element
 *                                and return it
 *   spListClear		      	  - Clears all the data from the list
